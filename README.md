intro

Hi Community, I dont know anything of coding but just exploring and following the guidelines. Yes, I am overwhelmed by the UI. A bit of myself, I'm an economics graduate with philosophy and pol sc as subsidiaries and currently pursuing MBA. I feel I'm technically an illiterate in this 21stC, I'm that typical end user of all the applied tech around the world but now I'm curious to get behind the screen and find out how you guys are so smart to develop all this crazy stuff in virtual world. Would want to write a paper on virtual ontologies maybe in future but as of now I just want to upskill my tech skills and develop some crazy stuff of my own , maybe contribute a tiny bit to this global high-tech ecosystem.
